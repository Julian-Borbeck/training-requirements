# Supervised Machine Learning

Supervised machine learning is a field of data science concerned with training predictive models for various tasks. An example would be a linear model that can predict a person's weight based on their height. In this miniproject, you will perform a supervised machine learning analysis and build a model that can predict whether passengers aboard the Titanic are likely to survive or not.

1. Sign up for Kaggle and start the Titanic challenge from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using typical methods (e.g., PCA, feature correlation, etc)
3. Create a binary classifier that can predict whether patients will live or not.
4. Submit your final predictions to Kaggle.
5. Refine the model until you have > 75% accuracy.
